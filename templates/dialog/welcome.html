  <h2>Welcome to H&acirc;rnMaster 3 for Foundry VTT</h2>
  <p>This system assists players and GMs in playing H&acirc;rnMaster 3
    by taking over much of the bookkeeping and mundane tasks,
    and speeding up the flow of combat through automation.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of features and capabilities that may not
    at first be apparent, so a comprehensive compendium of
    helpful journal entries has been included. Throughout the
    system you will see the More Info icon (<i class="far fa-question-circle"></i>) that you may
    click on for detailed information on that area. You may
    also view the documenation in the Compendium by going to
    the sidebar, clicking on the "Compendium Packs" tab (<i class="fas fa-atlas"></i>), and then
    choosing the "HM3 System Help" journal compendium.</p>
