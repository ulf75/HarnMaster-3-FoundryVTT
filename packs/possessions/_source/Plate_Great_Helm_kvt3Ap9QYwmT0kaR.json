    "description": "<p>Any closed plate helm that covers the skull, face, and neck; the eyes are mostly protected. Great helms give complete protection to the head but some warriors dislike the restricted vision. A great helm can only be worn with an arming cap or short quilted cowl.</p><h4>Plate Armour</h4><p>Any metal (usually iron or steel) that forms a rigid continuous covering. Plate armour is the pinnacle of the armourer’s craft. It is expensive and used mainly for helms and spot protection such as breastplates. It offers good to excellent defense against all strikes. Plate armour is relatively rare and articulated plate is unknown in Lythia.</p>",
