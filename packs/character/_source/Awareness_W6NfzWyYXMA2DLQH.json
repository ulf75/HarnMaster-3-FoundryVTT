Awareness may be tested when a character says something like, “I'll look around.” It also is tested if an event occurs and the GM wishes to determine who might have noticed it, or at least have noticed that something is out of place.</p><p>Awareness rolls are often made secretly by the GM. MS may give a vague feeling (hunch) that something is amiss or that all is not as it should be. Awareness tests may be made for sleeping characters at (no more than) half ML.</p>",
