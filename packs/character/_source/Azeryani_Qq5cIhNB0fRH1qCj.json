On Hârn, it is usually Hârnic.</p><p>Languages are tested only on special occasions, such as when foreigners converse. Characters are presumed to speak their native tongues well enough to make success rolls unnecessary. The EML of a skill using language can never exceed language ML in the tongue used.</p>",
