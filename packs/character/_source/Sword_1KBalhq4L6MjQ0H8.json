    "description": "<p>The variety of swords numbers in the hundreds. Their use is restricted by law in most civilized regions to legitimate military units, sometimes only to officers or knights. A sword fight generally consists of one combatant swinging or thrusting the blade while his opponent dodges or blocks with a shield. Blocking or parrying with a sword is rarely a good idea, and knights caught without a shield often yield or flee. See also Bastard Sword, Battlesword, Broadsword, Estoc, Falchion, Vagorsereq, Mang, Mankar, Shortsword, Thanath.</p>",
