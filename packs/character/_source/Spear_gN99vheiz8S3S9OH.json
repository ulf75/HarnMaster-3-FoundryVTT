    "description": "<p>The spear is probably the most common weapon in the world, and there are many varieties. Shafts are usually between 5 and 6 feet long and the point may be anything from fire-hardened wood to a 12-inch metal blade. They are most effective in melee when used two-handed like a quarterstaff, allowing for subtle defenses and blunt or point strikes. This takes great skill, so they are more commonly used as thrusting weapons, either one- or two-handed.</p>",
