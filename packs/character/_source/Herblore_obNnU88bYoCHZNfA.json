Skilled gatherers earn a reasonable living.</p><p>When trying to find and gather specific plants in the natural environment, test Herblore once per watch (four hours) of searching. EML is modified according to the plant's rarity. Seeking a plant in an inappropriate locale should further reduce EML, perhaps to zero.</p>",
