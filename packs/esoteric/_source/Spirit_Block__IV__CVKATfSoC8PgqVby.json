Touch is required.</p><p>Spirit Block creates a psychic bond between the subject and the caster. The caster can read surface thoughts and emotions, direct the subject's physical actions, and ask questions. Non-sentient creatures cannot answer questions.  Questions must be very simple and specific; controlled entities do not volunteer information. The subject must remain in plain view of the caster, and cannot be directed to perform strenuous or complex physical activities.</p><p>An intense psychic bond is created between the caster and all affected living entities. Any pain received by an affected victim also applies to the caster at GM discretion.
