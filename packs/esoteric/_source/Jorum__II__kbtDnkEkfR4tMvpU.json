    "description": "<p>A major/minor artifact power installed in an object to enable it to hold and store raw Principle. The enchantment creates a neutral Jorum which can be filled with the Principle of any convocation to which the caster is attuned.  A Jorum holds sufficient Principle to power any one spell of the appropriate convocation.</p><p>If installed as a major power, a Jorum “occupies” th (3) points of Ego/Will. If installed as a minor power, it cannot be combined with any other enchantment. Duration is Permanent if the power is installed when the artifact is made/grown; otherwise, it is Indefinite.</p><p>The existence of a Jorum does not mean it actually contains any Principle. To fill a Jorum, a mage simply casts Jorum again, but uses the CML of the convocation to be stored. EML is still modified by Jorum complexity (-10).</p><p>A Jorum containing appropriate Principle is required for the attunement process to each new convocation.  Another mage from the desired convocation will have to fill the Jorum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><p>Note: Principle stored in a Jorum is normally used to power a spell. It can, however, simply be released into the mundane world. This is very dangerous, but can create an interesting “diversion” provided the caster can effec a quick (preferably simultaneous) departure to avoid the consequences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI hours</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Duration: Indefinite/Permanent (see above)</p>",
