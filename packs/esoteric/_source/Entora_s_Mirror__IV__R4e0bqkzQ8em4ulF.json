The image is a “snapshot” of the object and will not normally change unless the object is destroyed, in which case the image vanishes.</p><p>With MS, the image is translucent; with CS, it is sharp and clear. The spell works best on simple objects/ images—more complex items should reduce EML.</p><p>With the basic spell, the object must be held by the caster and the image cannot be projected beyond good line of sight within CSI hexes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML50+</td><td>Line of Sight to image no longer required, but Range is still CSI hexes.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML60+</td><td>Range increases to CSI miles.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML70+</td><td>Image now a 3–dimensional hologram.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML80+</td><td>Image may be more closely linked to its object--it will move as the object moves, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML90+</td><td>A single image attribute, such as size or</td></tr></table><p>color, may be varied slightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 35-CSI seconds</p><p>Range: Touch (to object)/CSI hexes (to image)</p><p>Duration: CSI minutes</p>",
