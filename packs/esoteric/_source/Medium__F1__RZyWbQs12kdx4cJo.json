    "description": "<h1>Medium (F1) 15&ndash;SI Mins</h1><p>Medium is subject to passive triggering (psionics 4). The talent may be used in one of three ways. Each requires a trance, accumulates fatigue, and has a separate skill roll.</p><p><strong>[1] Communion</strong>: If successful, the invoker is able to clearly perceive and communicate, for SI minutes, with any ethereal within ML yards.</p><p><strong>[2] Summon</strong>: An attempt to summon an ethereal currently perceived by the invoker, or whose true name is known. Some entities require CS to be summoned. CF breaks the trance.</p><p><strong>[3] Control</strong>: An attempt to command an ethereal the invoker has summoned. If the ethereal&rsquo;s will is greater, invoker EML is reduced by five times the difference. Some ethereals are beyond control. With MS, the ethereal may be commanded to perform&nbsp; a simple task such as answer a yes/no question within its knowledge, or dispossess a body. With CS, the task/question may be more complex. With MF, the ethereal probably departs. With CF, the spirit may have possessed the invoker (see HaÌ‚rnMaster Religion).</p><p><strong>Psionic Episodes</strong>: Very scary nightmares, the dim perception of &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; here and there, a dread of graveyards, hearing voices, etc.</p><p><strong>Misfire (CF)</strong>: Sometimes an itinerant ethereal is released into the invoker&rsquo;s world. This occurs more often when such entities are hostile, violent, or in search of a body.</p>",
