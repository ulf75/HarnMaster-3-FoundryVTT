    "description": "<p>A spell to detect/identify metallic minerals. The caster declares a specific metallic mineral and learns the direction to the nearest (single) “good source” within CSI x 500 f With CS, the caster also learns the distance to the source.</p><p>Good sources vary at GM discretion. A small amount of refined metal in close proximity is more noticeable than a large deposit of ore a hundred yards away. Although the spell ignores any Focus through which it is cast, it may detect a companion's sword.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML70+</td><td>Caster may narrow the direction of the search, such as to ignore everything behind the caster, or search only in a cone within 20 degrees of true north, etc.</td></tr></table><p>Note: This spell has been used more than once to determine the size of a nearby person's moneypurse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI minutes (Trance)</p><p>Range: CSI x500 feet</p><p>Duration: None</p>",
