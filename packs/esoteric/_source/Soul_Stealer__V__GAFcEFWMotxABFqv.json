    "description": "<p>A spell to transfer a willing natural or artificial personality from one source body/artifact to a target body/artifact.</p><p>The spell is used to give an artifact a personality, or exorcise an unwanted personality from its present body/ artifact. The personality may be unwilling to transfer, and can resist with a Will/Ego x5 (MS casting) or a Will/Ego x2 (CS casting) morale check.</p><p>The transferred personality retains all memories and other personality attributes. Any mental skills or talents (such as Psionics) are also retained.</p><p>With the basic spell, the source body dies or the artifact self-destructs unless reoccupied within CSI minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML80+</td><td>Caster may transfer a personality without destroying its source body/artifact, provided it is reoccupied within CSI hours.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML100+</td><td>Instead of moving the source personality, the caster is able to copy it, leaving the source as before (many subjects prefer this approach).</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Disposing of souls is considered witchcraft and is punishable by death in most jurisdictions.
