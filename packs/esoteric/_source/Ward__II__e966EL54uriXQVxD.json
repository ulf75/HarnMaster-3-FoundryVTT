    "description": "<p>Wards protect objects from enchantment, or enchantments from magical interference. The ward must be specific to a chosen convocation to which the caster must be attuned.</p><p>If installed as a major power, a Ward occupies one (1) point of Ego/Will. If installed as a minor power, it cannot be combined with any other enchantment. Wards never have Permanent Duration; most are Indefinite, but the caster may designate a lesser Duration.</p><p>The value of a ward depends on casting success and the CSI of the chosen convocation:</p><p>MS = CSI/2           CS = CSI</p><p>Example: a mage with Neutral CML 50 has a Ward EML of 50-10=40. The 10 point penalty is for the complexity level of Ward. The mage wishes to create a Jmorvi ward.  With MS, and a Jmorvi CSI 6, a Jmorvi Ward 3 is created.</p><p>A ward is fully effective while in place and must be dispelled to be removed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><p>(none)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI minutes</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Duration: Indefinite (or lessâ€“caster choice)</p>",
