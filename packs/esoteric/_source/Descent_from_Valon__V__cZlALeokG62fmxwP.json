This is an extremely difficult ceremony, which burns a great deal of incense, and requires copious amounts of holy water. EML is reduced by the number of hours the victim has been dead at the conclusion of the ritual. The patient revives with any success. All mortal wounds and/or diseases are restored to a healing rate of H1 (MS) or H2 (CS.). The patient may still die and additional healing is advisable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
