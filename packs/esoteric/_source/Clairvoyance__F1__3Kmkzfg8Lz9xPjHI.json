    "description": "<p>The ability to visualize events currently occurring at a remote location. A target may sense the attention of a clairvoyant; test a multiple of the target&rsquo;s aura, or sensitivity&nbsp;talent if applicable. clairvoyance&nbsp;may be used in either of two ways:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[1] Near: The clairvoyant enters a trance for 25&ndash;SI seconds to transfer their point of perception to a location up to ML yards away. The location must be familiar to the clairvoyant. MS enables the clairvoyant to watch; CS allows the clairvoyant to also listen and smell. The vision lasts for SI minutes.</p><p>[2] Far: The clairvoyant enters a trance for 25-S1 minutes and attempts to focus on a specific, remote person or object whose location may not be known. The clairvoyant does this by visualizing the person&rsquo;s face (or by describing the object).</p><p>MS gains a blurred or vague vision of the person/ object&rsquo;s current situation and activities; CS gives a clearer vision. There are no range restrictions, but there is also no chance to listen or smell.</p><p>Psionic Episodes: Vivid dreams of faraway people and things. Dizziness, disorientation, confusion, headaches, sleepwalking, blurred vision, or mirage- like hallucinations can also occur.</p><p>Misfire (CF): False or random information is given to the clairvoyant. Sometimes, severe headaches that cause temporary blindness occurs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n",
