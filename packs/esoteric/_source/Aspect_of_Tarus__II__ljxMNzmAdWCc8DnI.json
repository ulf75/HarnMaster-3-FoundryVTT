    "description": "<p>An enchantment which transforms the surface of a wholly metallic object into another metal. The enchantment is fragile, and, because it only places an extremely thin veneer, “transformed” objects will not pass more than a cursory inspection. Scratching the object, even with a fingernail, removes some of the plating. With CS, adhesion is better, and the observer has to scratch with an object harder than the plating metal to reveal the solid metal underneath.</p><p>With the basic enchantment, the transformation can only be to a lower-density metal (e.g., from lead to copper).</p><p>Aspect of Tarus cannot be combined with any other enchantment.</p><p>The maximum weight of the object is CSI lbs. The caster must have a minimum one-ounce seed of the plating metal, but the seed is unaffected by the enchantment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML80+</td><td>Transformation may be from any metal to any other metal, meaning lead can be plated to look like gold.</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI rounds</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Duration: CSI hours</p>",
