    "description": "<p>A spell which creates a brief interworld portal in the form of a hazy ellipse 3–8 feet tall and 2–5 feet wide. I hovers one foot above the ground, behind the caster, and is visible only from the front side. Anyone/anything small enough may pass through the gate.</p><p>The caster visualizes a specific destination and Gate o Kemdal determines a path there with 13-CSI stops. At each stop, a new casting is made to determine progress with the following results:</p><p>CS: Advance two stops along path.</p><p>MS: Advance one stop along path.</p><p>MF: No progress. Retreat one stop.</p><p>CF: No progress. Add one stop to path.</p><p>The journey seems to take about one minute per stop, but actually takes one day per stop. Fatigue is reduced to zero at each stop.</p><p>The final destination is known by the caster, but the path taken is always variable and obscure. The destination cannot be determined by anyone else except with a critically successful divination.</p><p>Gate of Kemdal avoids crowds. It almost never materializes travellers where their appearance can be witnessed. However, any number of beings could wander by within seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><p>(none)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 35-CSI seconds</p><p>Range: n/a</p><p>Duration: CSI rounds</p>",
