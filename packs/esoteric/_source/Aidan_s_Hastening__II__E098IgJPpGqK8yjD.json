    "description": "<p>A self-enchantment to increase the caster's Move attribute (see Combat 2 & 6) by 50% (MS) or 100% (CS).</p><p>A skill's ML is increased by five times the attribute increase when the skill is being used in a manner which requires physical movement. For example, the Jumping skill would eligible for the ML increase for a running jump, but not for a standing jump.</p><p>Example: Scrope has an Agility of 12, so his Move is normally 12. He lays Aidan's Hastening upon himself with MS, so his Move increases by 50% to 18. Since the increase in his Move is six, the ML of any skill use requiring physi movement is increased by 6 x 5 = 30.</p><p>While enchanted, the caster accrues fatigue (from activities involving physical movement) at twice the normal rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML70+</td><td>Enchantment may be laid upon a willing recipient. Touch is required.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML90+</td><td>Subject's fatigue accumulation rate is now normal.</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Warning: This spell achieves its effect by drastically increasing the caster's metabolism. Because of this, the r at which the caster bleeds, for example, is increased by the same percentage rate as Move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI seconds</p><p>Range: Self/Touch at CML70+</p><p>Duration: CSI rounds</p>",
